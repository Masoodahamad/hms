Hospital Management System (HMS)
================================

This project is a Flask-based Hospital Management System (HMS) designed to simplify
the management of hospital operations, including patients, doctors, and appointments.
It provides a RESTful backend that allows for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
operations through APIs and integrates email notifications for appointment updates.

Key Features
------------
1. **Patient Management**
   - Add, view, update, and delete patient records.
   - Store personal details such as name, age, gender, and contact information.

2. **Doctor Management**
   - Manage doctor profiles, including their names, specializations, and schedules.

3. **Appointment Management**
   - Schedule and manage appointments between patients and doctors.
   - Prevent overlapping time slots and ensure valid associations.

4. **Email Notifications**
   - Send automatic appointment confirmations and reminders using SMTP.
   - Configurable through environment variables and `.env` file.

5. **Database Integration**
   - Uses SQLAlchemy ORM for easy database operations.
   - Default support for SQLite (configurable for MySQL/PostgreSQL).

6. **REST API Support**
   - Provides JSON-based API endpoints for integration with frontends or third-party systems.

7. **Security & Configuration**
   - Includes configurable secret key and email credentials via environment variables.
   - Supports TLS/SSL for secure email transmission.
